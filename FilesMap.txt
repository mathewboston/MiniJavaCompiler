Files description:



antlr4.bat: the generic batch file to run antlr on a grammar

compile.bat: a batch file I used to call antlr4 and compile the .java files

FilesMap.txt: this file

indentedTree.txt: an example of an indented tree, for if you want to attempt the extra credit

MiniJava.g4: a grammar for MiniJava, modified from assignment 1

run.bat: a batch file I used to run the TestGrammar program on TestLinkedList.java & Precedence.java

Precedence.java: to use as input, unchanged from assignment 1

TestLinkedList.java: to use as input, unchanged from assignment 1

SymbolAttributes.java: a class describing an entry in the symbol table

SymbolTable.java: a class with code for implementing the Symbol Table

SymTableVisitor.java: a class extending the generated MiniJavaBaseVisitor class. It contains the code to visit the parse tree and generate the symbol table.

TestTypeCheckVisitor.java: the program that parses the MiniJava program, produces the parse tree, and visits the parse tree to generate a rudimentary symbol table.

TypeCheckVisitor.java: the class that checks to insure all type match each other.

To run this program, I run the compile.bat batch file, then the run.bat batch file. If we don't need recompiling, just run the run.bat batch file again.
